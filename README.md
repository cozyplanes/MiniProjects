**Password Generator**     
My first mini project!     
It is a simple password generator implementation made in both `C#` and `Ruby`. When you check out, generator made in `Rudy` is much more beautiful. (Just personal thoughts. xD)    
Pretty self-explanotory... Put your desired characters in `chars` string and the length of the generated password in `length`.

**UItest in C**       
Testing upon how ascii code is displayed across devices.       
See `master/UItest/README.md` for details.
