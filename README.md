**Password Generator**
My first mini project so far..     
It is a simple password generator implementation made in both `C#` and `Ruby`. When you check out, generator made in `Rudy` is much more beautiful. (Just personal thoughts. xD)    
Pretty self-explanotory... Put your desired characters in `chars` string and the length of the generated password in `length`.
